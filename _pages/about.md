Hi, I’m Badhan Mazumder. I’m a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Georgia State University, advised by [Dr. Dong Hye Ye](https://cas.gsu.edu/profile/dong-hye-ye/) and [Dr. Vince D. Calhoun](https://cas.gsu.edu/profile/vince-calhoun/), and affiliated with the Tri-Institutional Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science [(TReNDS)](https://trendscenter.org/).

My research lies broadly in multimodal representation learning, with applications to brain network organization and neuroimaging analysis. I am currently developing scalable, Riemannian geometry–aware, and physics-inspired models for longitudinal multimodal brain connectivity and dynamics.
More broadly, my interests include graph neural networks (GNNs), multimodal fusion, Riemannian manifold, and theory-informed machine learning, with an emphasis on interpretable and robust modeling for large-scale neuroimaging data.

Feel free to reach me at: bmazumder1[at]student.gsu.edu
